### What data structure did you use to store the lines read from the input file?
The data structure I used to store the lines read from the input file was a List of Line objects which I defined in the line package.

### What data structure did you use to store the circularly shifted lines (or their indexes)?
I stored the circularly shifted lines in a list of lines as well, but I used temporary linked lists for easy pointer movement in between.
### What data structure did you use to store the sorted lines (or their indexes)?
I stored the sorted lines in a list of line objects as well, for easy use of the Collections.sort() builtin method.
