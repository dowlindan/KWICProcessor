The toaster blinked like it knew a secret.
Rain argued softly with the window.
Someone left a shoe in the freezer.
The cat judged everyone in silence.
A bus stop smelled like old coffee.
He forgot why he opened the door.
The clock skipped a beat at noon.
Wind rearranged the papers on the desk.
A neon sign hummed off-key.
Breakfast tasted like a bad decision.
